## 📈 Insights and Recommendations

**Insight 1: Peak Sales Hours**
- Insight: Mornings (07-10 AM) are peak sales hours.
- Recommendation: Double down on mornings by adding staff to reduce wait times and maximize peak revenue. Revive 		afternoons with discounted coffee-pastry combos or iced beverages. Promote evening specials to drive 		late-day traffic.

**Insight 2: Dominant Product Categories**
- Insight: Coffee and Tea contribute to almost 70% of daily revenue.
- Recommendation: Expand coffee-related upsells (e.g., premium blends, subscriptions) to reinforce purchasing habits. 		Create combo deals (e.g., “Coffee + Other category items at 10% off”) to increase sales of lower 		category items.

**Insight 3: High-Performing Store Locations**
- Insight: Lower Manhattan shows the highest sales volume, while Hell’s Kitchen is the most profitable branch.
- Recommendation: Leverage Lower Manhattan's high sales volume by testing upselling strategies (e.g., add pastry for 		$2) to further boost transaction value. Optimize Hell’s Kitchen's volume by promoting premium 			products (e.g., merchandise, coffee beans) to increase ATV.
